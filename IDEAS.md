# AI Image Describer: Future Directions & Use Cases

> **Note:** The app supports multiple "generation types" (e.g., game, comics, business, education). Templates store this type to enable context-specific features and UI. All new features should be designed to check and respect the template's type.

This document captures a range of future directions for the AI Image Describer app, including both game mechanics and creative/business/educational use cases. These ideas are intended to inspire future development and ensure the codebase remains flexible and extensible.

## 1. Game Mechanics Ideas

> **Note:** All game mechanics should be implemented in a way that checks the template's generation type and only activates if appropriate.

- **Branching Choices / Player Decisions**
  - After each turn, present the player with choices that affect stats, story direction, or future prompts.
- **Inventory & Items**
  - Players can find or earn items that boost stats, unlock story paths, or are used in later turns.
- **Skill Checks / Dice Rolls**
  - Add RPG-style skill checks (e.g., Perception, Wisdom) that use stats and random rolls to determine outcomes.
  - **Dice Roll System**: Implement comprehensive dice mechanics (d4, d6, d8, d10, d12, d20, d100)
  - **Critical Success/Failure**: Natural 1s and 20s create dramatic outcomes
  - **Stat Modifiers**: Character stats (INT, CRE, PER, WIS) modify dice rolls
  - **Combat System**: Turn-based combat with attack rolls, damage calculation, and health management
  - **Status Effects**: Poison, healing, temporary buffs/debuffs that affect gameplay
  - **Death & Resurrection**: High-stakes gameplay with recovery mechanics
- **Achievements & Quests**
  - Add achievements for creative play and introduce quests or objectives (e.g., 'Find the lost artifact').
- **Character Progression**
  - Level up, gain new traits, or unlock abilities as the game progresses.
- **Competitive or Cooperative Play**
  - Multiple players can take turns or compete for the best story/score.
- **Random Events / Encounters**
  - Trigger random events between turns to add unpredictability.
- **Visual Progression / Map**
  - Show a map or visual journey as the player progresses.
- **Multiple Endings & Replayability**
  - Different endings based on choices, stats, and items.
- **Combat & Health System**
  - **Health Management**: Track character health (0-200) with visual indicators
  - **Damage Calculation**: Dice-based damage with character stats affecting outcomes
  - **Combat Choices**: Fight, flee, or negotiate with different risk/reward ratios
  - **Combat History**: Track all combat events and dice rolls for replay
  - **Experience System**: Award XP for successful combat and skill checks
  - **Level Progression**: Unlock new abilities and increase stats through experience
- **Strict Per-Turn UI Gating**
  - The UI only shows upload, generate story, and choices controls at the correct stage for the current turn, ensuring a clear, stepwise RPG flow and preventing user confusion.

## 2. Creative, Business, and Educational Use Cases

- **Marketing & Branding Storytelling**
  - Generate campaign or brand stories from product images.
- **Content Creation & Social Media**
  - Create Instagram carousel stories, YouTube scripts, or newsletter narratives from images.
- **Education & Learning**
  - Use as a creative writing prompt, explainer tool, or language learning aid.
- **Business & Team Building**
  - Build vision/mission stories, pitch decks, or case studies from images.
- **Personal & Creative Use**
  - Generate memory collages, gift stories, or art narratives.
- **Advertising & Copywriting**
  - Create ad copy, slogans, or campaign themes from images.
- **Event Planning**
  - Storyboard events, generate recaps, or create invitations.
- **Comics & Visual Storytelling**
  - Write comic strips or storyboards from image panels.

**Note:**
These ideas are not all implemented yet, but the codebase should remain open and extensible to support them in the future. Avoid hardcoding logic that would make these directions difficult to add later.
