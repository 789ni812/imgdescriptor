STAT GUIDELINES:
- strength: 1-200 (physical power, influenced by size, build, and equipment)
- agility: 1-100 (speed, reflexes, and maneuverability)
- health: 20-1000 (endurance and vitality, consider size and apparent toughness)
- defense: 1-100 (damage resistance and blocking ability)
- luck: 1-50 (random chance factors, critical hits, evasive maneuvers)
- age: 1-1000000 (character age, affects experience and wisdom)
- size: "small" | "medium" | "large" (physical stature)
- build: "thin" | "average" | "muscular" | "heavy" (body composition)
- magic: 0-100 (supernatural powers, only if character clearly has magical abilities)

- intelligence: 1-100 (tactical thinking, strategy, and problem-solving)
