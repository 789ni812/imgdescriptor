## Current Status: In Progress ðŸš§
- **Phases 1-8:** Complete
- **Phase 9: Iconography & Action Elements Refinement:** In Progress
- **Phase 10: Final Polish & Readme:** Not Started

---

## Project Overview
A Next.js application that allows users to upload images and get AI-generated descriptions and stories using the LM Studio SDK. The project follows a strict Test-Driven Development (TDD) workflow.

## Development Phases

### Phase 1: Setup & Basic Structure - âœ… **Complete**
1.  Create Next.js project with TypeScript
2.  Install dependencies (LM Studio SDK, Tailwind CSS)
3.  Set up basic layout and routing
4.  Configure and verify Jest TDD environment
5.  Push initial setup to GitHub

### Phase 2: Core Components - âœ… **Complete**
1.  Implement image upload functionality
2.  Create image preview component
3.  Build description display component

### Phase 3: LM Studio Integration - âœ… **Complete**
1.  Set up LM Studio client
2.  Implement API route for image analysis
3.  Connect frontend to backend

### Phase 4: Polish & Testing - âœ… **Complete**
1.  Add error handling
2.  Implement loading states
3.  Test with various image types
4.  Responsive design testing

### Phase 5: Enhanced Description Display - âœ… **Complete**
1.  **Parse and Structure Description**: Instead of a single text block, parse the description string based on the `**Category:**` markers.
2.  **Implement Markdown Rendering**: Use a library like `react-markdown` to render the parsed sections, turning `**...**` into bold text.
3.  **Refine Component Layout**: Display the categories and their corresponding text in a clean, readable, structured format (e.g., labeled sections or cards).
4.  **Add "Copy to Clipboard" Feature**: Implement a button to allow the user to copy the raw description text.

### Phase 6: AI Story Generation - âœ… **Complete**
1.  **Backend Story Generation:**
    *   Create a new API route at `/api/generate-story`.
    *   This route will accept an `{ description: string }` payload.
    *   It will call the second LM Studio model with a specific story-generation prompt.
2.  **Frontend UI Components:**
    *   Create a new `StoryDisplay.tsx` component to show the generated story.
    *   Create a "Generate Story" button component.
    *   Write Jest tests for the new components.
3.  **Frontend Integration:**
    *   Add state variables in `page.tsx` for the story.
    *   Call the `/api/generate-story` endpoint.
    *   Display the `StoryDisplay` component.
4.  **Final Testing:**
    *   Perform end-to-end testing of the workflow.

### Phase 7: UI/UX Overhaul - âœ… **Complete**
This phase transformed the application from a functional prototype into a polished tool with a consistent design language.
- **Tasks Completed:** Defined color palette and typography, created Header/Footer, overhauled core components (`ImageUpload`, `ImagePreview`, `DescriptionDisplay`, `StoryDisplay`) with modern card-based styling and improved functionality using `react-dropzone`.

### Phase 8: Advanced UI Polish & Layout Refinement - âœ… **Complete**
This phase focused on refining the overall structure and visual appeal of the application.
- **Tasks Completed:** Implemented a global centered content container, redesigned the Header and Footer with proper styling, enhanced text readability on display cards, and implemented a responsive two-column grid layout.

### Phase 9: Iconography & Action Elements Refinement - ðŸš§ **In Progress**
The goal of this phase is to improve usability and visual clarity by making icons and buttons more intuitive and appropriately styled.

- **Task 9.1: Refine and Control Icon Visibility & Style** - *Complete*
  - **Action:** Replaced placeholder SVGs with smaller, more conventional icons from `heroicons`. Conditionally rendered `ImagePreview` and `DescriptionDisplay` to clean up the initial view.
  - **Commit:** `feat(icons): replace placeholder with heroicons and control visibility`.

- **Task 9.2: Redesign Buttons for Clarity and Emphasis** - *Complete*
  - **Action:** Refactored the `Button` component to be variant-based (`primary`, `destructive`). Applied the `destructive` variant to the "Remove Image" button for better UX.
  - **Commit:** `feat(ui): implement variant-based buttons`.

- **Task 9.3: Reduce Icon Size Further (`w-12 h-12`)** - *Complete*
  - **TDD:** Wrote a failing test to assert the upload icon has `w-12` and `h-12` classes. Updated the component to pass the test.
  - **Commit:** `feat(icons): reduce icon size to w-12 h-12`.

- **Task 9.4: Correctly Scale Upload Icon Size and Stroke** - *Complete*
  - **TDD:** Added custom CSS for `stroke-width`, updated `ImageUpload.test.tsx` to assert larger size (`w-16 h-16`) and custom stroke class. Updated component to pass.
  - **Commit:** `feat(icons): increase upload icon size and apply custom stroke width`.

- **Task 9.5: Reduce Upload Icon Size to `w-14 h-14`** - *Complete*
  - **TDD:** Wrote a failing test to assert the `ArrowUpOnSquareIcon` has `w-14` and `h-14` classes. Updated the component to pass.
  - **Commit:** `feat(icons): reduce upload icon size to w-14`.

- **Task 9.6: Debug Icon Size and Verify Tailwind** - *Complete*
  - **TDD (Header):** Write a failing test in `Header.test.tsx` to assert the title has a `text-blue-400` class. Updated the component to pass.
  - **TDD (Icon):** Write a failing test in `ImageUpload.test.tsx` to assert the icon is wrapped in a `div` with inline styles `width: 50px` and `height: 50px`.
  - **Code:** Added the wrapper `div` in `ImageUpload.tsx` to pass the test.
  - **Commit:** `fix(ui): wrap upload icon and verify tailwind`.
