# Git Best Practices

When interacting with Git, follow these guidelines:

- **Commit Messages:**
    - Write clear, concise, and descriptive commit messages.
    - Use a conventional commit style (e.g., `feat: add new user authentication`, `fix: resolve login bug`, `docs: update README`).
    - The subject line should be 50 characters or less, followed by an optional blank line and a more detailed body.
- **Branching Strategy:**
    - Work on feature branches for new functionalities (`feature/your-feature-name`).
    - Use `bugfix/your-bug-name` for bug fixes.
    - Rebase frequently to keep branches up-to-date with `main` or `develop`.

    - Ensure all changes are committed before starting a new task or switching branches.
