# Jest TDD Workflow

Strictly adhere to Test-Driven Development (TDD) principles when implementing features or fixing bugs.

**Environment Setup (Windows + Git Bash):**

- **Use Git Bash:** Always use Git Bash terminal, not PowerShell or CMD for npm commands.
- **Project Directory:** Ensure you're in the correct project directory (where package.json is) before running tests.
- **Dependencies:** Install all required testing libraries:
  ```bash
  npm install --save-dev jest jest-environment-jsdom @testing-library/react @testing-library/jest-dom @types/jest
  ```
- **Jest Config:** Use `jest.config.js` (not .ts) for maximum compatibility:
  ```js
  const nextJest = require('next/jest.js');
  const createJestConfig = nextJest({ dir: './' });
  const config = {
    coverageProvider: 'v8',
    testEnvironment: 'jsdom',
    setupFilesAfterEnv: ['<rootDir>/jest.setup.ts'],
    moduleNameMapper: { '^@/(.*)$': '<rootDir>/src/$1' },
  };
  module.exports = createJestConfig(config);
  ```
- **npm Scripts:** Use `npx --no jest` in package.json to force local resolution:
  ```json
  "test": "npx --no jest",
  "test:watch": "npx --no jest --watch"
  ```

**Process:**

1.  **Write a Failing Test:**
    * Before writing any production code, first write a **minimal** test case that describes the desired behavior.
    * This test **must fail** when run against the current codebase (because the feature doesn't exist yet).
    * Focus on the *behavior* of the code, not its internal implementation details.
    * Place tests alongside components: `ComponentName.test.tsx`.
2.  **Run Tests (Verify Failure):**
    * Execute `npm test -- path/to/test/file.test.tsx` to confirm the new test fails.
    * If it passes, the test is not correct or not truly testing the new functionality.
3.  **Write Minimal Code to Pass the Test:**
    * Write *only* the necessary production code to make the *current failing test pass*.
    * Avoid implementing future features or over-engineering at this stage.
4.  **Run Tests (Verify Pass):**
    * Execute `npm test -- path/to/test/file.test.tsx` to confirm all tests (including the new one) now pass.
5.  **Refactor:**
    * Once the tests pass, refactor the code to improve its design, readability, and maintainability. Ensure tests continue to pass after refactoring.
    * The AI *must* re-run tests after any refactoring.
6.  **Full Regression Test:**
    *   After the specific feature's tests are passing, run the entire test suite (`npm test`).
    *   Ensure that no existing functionality has been broken by the new changes.
7.  **Build Verification:**
    *   Run `npm run build` to ensure the production build passes.
    *   This step is critical to catch any build-time issues before deployment.
8.  **Browser Preview:**
    *   **Check for Running Dev Server:** Check if localhost:3000 is running and stop it if needed.
    *   **Start Dev Server:** Run `npm run dev` to start the development server for browser review.
    *   **Notify User:** Inform the user that the dev server is running and they can review changes at http://localhost:3000.
9.  **Document and Commit:**
    *   **Update Spec:** After tests pass, update the `spec.md` or relevant project plan to mark the task as complete.
    *   **Stage Changes:** Automatically stage all changes using `git add .`.
    *   **Commit Changes:** Commit the work with a clear, conventional commit message (e.g., `feat(ui): implement Header component`).
10. **Repeat:**
    * For the next piece of functionality or edge case, go back to step 1.

**Test File Conventions:**

-   Use `.test.ts` or `.spec.ts` suffix for test files.
-   Place test files alongside their components: `ComponentName.test.tsx`.
-   Organize tests logically, mirroring the project structure.

**Browser Preview Commands:**

- **Check if localhost:3000 is running:**
  ```bash
  netstat -ano | findstr :3000
  ```
- **Stop the dev server if running:**
  ```bash
  taskkill /F /PID <PID>  # Replace <PID> with the actual process ID
  ```
- **Start dev server:**
  ```bash
  npm run dev
  ```

**Troubleshooting Common Issues:**

- **Module not found errors:** Ensure all dependencies are installed and you're in the correct directory.
- **PowerShell execution policy errors:** Always use Git Bash for npm commands.
- **Jest not found:** Use `npx --no jest` in package.json scripts.
- **Environment errors:** If issues persist, run:
  ```bash
  rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json
  npm cache clean --force
  npm install
  ```
- **Port 3000 already in use:** Use the browser preview commands above to properly manage the dev server.

**Important:** The AI *must* run tests using the appropriate `npm test -- file.test.tsx` commands in the terminal after making code changes. If tests fail, the AI *must* identify the issue, propose a fix, apply it, and re-run tests until they pass before considering the task complete. Provide clear log outputs if tests fail. After successful builds, the AI *must* start the dev server for browser review.
