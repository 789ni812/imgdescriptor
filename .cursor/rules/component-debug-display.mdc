# Component Debug Display

To aid in development and debugging, a special wrapper component, `DevDebugWrapper`, is available to display a component's filename directly in the browser.

## Usage

Wrap any component in `page.tsx` (or other page files) with the `DevDebugWrapper` and provide its filename as a prop.

### Example:

```tsx
import { DevDebugWrapper } from '@/components/dev/DevDebugWrapper';
import { MyComponent } from '@/components/MyComponent';

// In your page component's render method:
<DevDebugWrapper filename="MyComponent.tsx">
  <MyComponent />
</DevDebugWrapper>
```

## Behavior

-   **Development Mode:** In the `development` environment, the wrapper will render a light gray border around the component and display the filename centered below it.
-   **Production Mode:** In the `production` environment, the wrapper renders nothing but its children (`<>...</>`), adding no overhead to the final build.

This convention should be used for all primary sub-components within a page to make it easier to identify which part of the UI corresponds to which file in the codebase.
