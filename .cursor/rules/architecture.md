# Architecture Documentation Rule

- All contributors must consult and update `ARCHITECTURE.md` when making architectural, structural, or organizational changes to the project.
- `ARCHITECTURE.md` is the canonical reference for project structure, state management, testing, and conventions.
- Any significant refactor, new feature, or change to folder structure, state management, or testing process must be reflected in this document.
