# AI Image Describer RPG - Project Overview for AI Assistants

## Project Summary

**AI Image Describer RPG** is a sophisticated Next.js/TypeScript application that transforms user-uploaded images into an interactive, turn-based storytelling game. The app uses an LLM (via LM Studio) to generate detailed image descriptions and branching story segments, creating a dynamic RPG experience where player choices shape the narrative.

## Core Technology Stack

- **Framework**: Next.js 15 (App Router)
- **Language**: TypeScript (strict mode, no `any` types)
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS v4 with shadcn/ui components
- **State Management**: Zustand with persistence
- **AI Integ
ration**: LM Studio SDK for local LLM processing
- **Testing**: Jest + React Testing Library (strict TDD)
- **Build**: Production-optimized with comprehensive error handling

## Key Features

### 1. **Turn-Based Storytelling System**
- 3-turn limit with dynamic turn management
- Each turn: image upload â†’ AI description â†’ story generation â†’ player choices
- **After a user selects a choice, the DM narrates the outcome, updates stats, and determines if the game continues or ends (game over) via `/api/dm-outcome`.**
- Story continuation across turns with full context preservation
- Per-turn accordion UI with loading states and content management

### 2. **AI Dungeon Master System**
- **DM Reflection & Adaptation**: AI DM reflects on each turn and adapts future content
- **Personality-Driven Storytelling**: Different DM personalities create unique experiences
- **Dynamic Difficulty Scaling**: Automatic adjustment based on player performance
- **Mood & Personality Evolution**: DM personality changes based on player actions
- **Adaptive Narratives**: Story direction changes based on player behavior

### 3. **Dungeon Master Agency & Gamebook Tone (2025-06-23)**

- The AI Dungeon Master (DM) is responsible for:
  - Actively adjusting the player's health and stats based on narrative events, choices, and remaining turns.
  - Making explicit, gamebook-style decisions and consequences, including the possibility of player death or stat-based outcomes.
  - Maintaining a consistent narrative tone inspired by classic gamebooks (e.g., Ian Livingstone's Forest of Doom). The DM's narration should be immersive, direct, and filled with tension and consequence.
  - Using prompt engineering to ensure the LLM always writes in this style. Example: 'Write the next story segment in the style of Ian Livingstone's Forest of Doom, with clear consequences and a sense of peril.'

### Choices Recap UI
- Each turn card must display all choices generated for that turn, with the user's selected choice clearly highlighted (e.g., border, background, or icon).
- The recap should appear below the story for best narrative flow.

### 4. **Character Development System**
- **Comprehensive Stats**: Intelligence, Creativity, Perception, Wisdom, Health
- **Moral Alignment**: Numeric alignment score (-100 to +100) with reputation tracking
- **Character Progression**: Stats evolve based on choices and story outcomes
- **Choice-Consequence Matrix**: Each choice affects character development

### 5. **Template Management System**
- **Portable Templates**: Save/load complete game sessions with full state
- **Template Types**: Support for different use cases (game, comics, business, etc.)
- **Import/Export**: Share templates with images and prompts
- **Template Editing**: Full CRUD operations with validation

### 6. **Good vs Bad Framework**
- **Moral Duality**: Configurable themes (hero-vs-villain, yin-yang, etc.)
- **Customizable Roles**: Define hero and villain characteristics
- **Profile Pictures**: Visual representation of good/bad entities
- **Narrative Integration**: Moral choices affect story direction

### 7. **Advanced UI/UX Features**
- **Responsive Design**: Modern, accessible interface with shadcn/ui components
- **Real-time Feedback**: Loading states, progress indicators, toast notifications
- **Visual Storytelling**: Image gallery with accordion-based content display
- **Debug System**: Comprehensive logging and monitoring capabilities

## Architecture Overview

### State Management
- **Zustand Stores**: Character, DM, Template stores with persistence
- **Client-Only Rendering**: All Zustand-dependent UI uses ClientOnly pattern
- **Type Safety**: Strict TypeScript interfaces for all state
- **Persistence**: Local storage integration with error handling

### AI Integration
- **LM Studio SDK**: Local LLM processing for privacy and performance
- **Mock Mode**: Full functionality testing without external APIs
- **Prompt Engineering**: Dynamic prompts with character context and DM personality
- **Error Handling**: Robust fallback mechanisms and retry logic

### Component Architecture
- **Modular Design**: Reusable components with clear separation of concerns
- **TDD Approach**: All components have comprehensive test coverage
- **Accessibility**: ARIA attributes and keyboard navigation support
- **Performance**: React.memo, useMemo, and useCallback optimizations

## Development Workflow

### TDD Process (Strictly Enforced)
1. **Write Failing Test**: Create comprehensive test suite covering all requirements
2. **Implement Code**: Write minimal code to make tests pass
3. **Refactor**: Clean up code while ensuring tests continue to pass
4. **Quality Assurance**: Run full test suite, build check, browser preview
5. **Documentation**: Update spec.md and commit with conventional commit message

### Testing Strategy
- **418 Tests Passing**: Comprehensive coverage across all components
- **Component Testing**: UI interactions, state changes, accessibility
- **Integration Testing**: API endpoints, store interactions, end-to-end flows
- **Mock Testing**: Full functionality without external dependencies

### Code Quality Standards
- **TypeScript Strict**: No `any` types, comprehensive interfaces
- **ESLint Compliance**: No linting errors or warnings
- **Performance**: Optimized rendering and state management
- **Documentation**: Inline comments and comprehensive documentation

## Key Technical Decisions

### 1. **Client-Only Rendering for Zustand**
- All UI components that depend on Zustand state use ClientOnly pattern
- Prevents hydration mismatches between server and client
- Ensures state consistency and eliminates SSR/CSR issues

### 2. **Dynamic Prompt System**
- Character stats, choices, and game state injected into AI prompts
- DM personality and mood affect story generation
- Adaptive difficulty scaling based on player performance
- Comprehensive prompt templates with placeholder system

### 3. **Template Portability**
- Templates stored as JSON with relative image paths
- No zip export required; folder copying enables sharing
- Version compatibility and migration support
- Template type system for different use cases

### 4. **Mock Mode Support**
