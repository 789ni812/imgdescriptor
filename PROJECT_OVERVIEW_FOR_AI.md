# AI Image Describer RPG - Project Overview for AI Assistants

## Project Summary

**AI Image Describer RPG** is a sophisticated Next.js/TypeScript application that transforms user-uploaded images into an interactive, turn-based storytelling game. The app uses an LLM (via LM Studio) to generate detailed image descriptions and branching story segments, creating a dynamic RPG experience where player choices shape the narrative. The system has evolved to include a comprehensive tournament system with AI-generated fighter introductions, battle commentary, and cinematic overviews.

## Core Technology Stack

- **Framework**: Next.js 15 (App Router)
- **Language**: TypeScript (strict mode, no `any` types)
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS v4 with shadcn/ui components
- **State Management**: Zustand with persistence
- **AI Integration**: LM Studio SDK for local LLM processing
- **Testing**: Jest + React Testing Library (strict TDD)
- **Build**: Production-optimized with comprehensive error handling

## Key Features

### 1. **Turn-Based Storytelling System**
- 3-turn limit with dynamic turn management
- Each turn: image upload â†’ AI description â†’ story generation â†’ player choices
- **After a user selects a choice, the DM narrates the outcome, updates stats, and determines if the game continues or ends (game over) via `/api/dm-outcome`.**
- Story continuation across turns with full context preservation
- Per-turn accordion UI with loading states and content management

### 2. **AI Dungeon Master System**
- **DM Reflection & Adaptation**: AI DM reflects on each turn and adapts future content
- **Personality-Driven Storytelling**: Different DM personalities create unique experiences
- **Dynamic Difficulty Scaling**: Automatic adjustment based on player performance
- **Mood & Personality Evolution**: DM personality changes based on player actions
- **Adaptive Narratives**: Story direction changes based on player behavior

### 3. **Dungeon Master Agency & Gamebook Tone (2025-06-23)**

- The AI Dungeon Master (DM) is responsible for:
  - Actively adjusting the player's health and stats based on narrative events, choices, and remaining turns.
  - Making explicit, gamebook-style decisions and consequences, including the possibility of player death or stat-based outcomes.
  - Maintaining a consistent narrative tone inspired by classic gamebooks (e.g., Ian Livingstone's Forest of Doom). The DM's narration should be immersive, direct, and filled with tension and consequence.
  - Using prompt engineering to ensure the LLM always writes in this style. Example: 'Write the next story segment in the style of Ian Livingstone's Forest of Doom, with clear consequences and a sense of peril.'

### 4. **Tournament System (2025-01-27)**
- **16-Fighter Tournament Support**: Enhanced from 8 to 16 fighters maximum
- **AI-Generated Fighter Introductions**: Dynamic slogans and descriptions for each fighter
- **Cinematic Tournament Overviews**: LLM-generated tournament summaries with fighter slideshows
- **Persistent LLM Content**: All generated content saved to tournament files for production use
- **Battle Commentary**: Rich, dynamic commentary for each match round
- **Tournament Bracket Visualization**: Single-elimination brackets with automatic bye handling

### 5. **Character Development System**
- **Comprehensive Stats**: Intelligence, Creativity, Perception, Wisdom, Health
- **Moral Alignment**: Numeric alignment score (-100 to +100) with reputation tracking
- **Character Progression**: Stats evolve based on choices and story outcomes
- **Choice-Consequence Matrix**: Each choice affects character development

### 6. **Template Management System**
- **Portable Templates**: Save/load complete game sessions with full state
- **Template Types**: Support for different use cases (game, comics, business, etc.)
- **Import/Export**: Share templates with images and prompts
- **Template Editing**: Full CRUD operations with validation

### 7. **Good vs Bad Framework**
- **Moral Duality**: Configurable themes (hero-vs-villain, yin-yang, etc.)
- **Customizable Roles**: Define hero and villain characteristics
- **Profile Pictures**: Visual representation of good/bad entities
- **Narrative Integration**: Moral choices affect story direction

### 8. **Advanced UI/UX Features**
- **Responsive Design**: Modern, accessible interface with shadcn/ui components
- **Real-time Feedback**: Loading states, progress indicators, toast notifications
- **Visual Storytelling**: Image gallery with accordion-based content display
- **Debug System**: Comprehensive logging and monitoring capabilities

# Project Overview: Narrative Consistency & Gameplay Improvements

## Narrative Consistency & Gameplay Flow

To ensure a more engaging and coherent RPG experience, the following improvements have been made:

### 1. Story Continuity
- Every story prompt now includes a summary of previous chapters, key choices, and consequences.
- This ensures the LLM builds on past events and maintains a logical narrative arc.

### 2. Villain & Player Context
- Prompts always include detailed villain state, motivations, and recent actions.
- The player's role as hero is explicitly stated, with current stats and recent choices.

### 3. Choice & Consequence Clarity
- Choices are output as strict JSON with clear types, descriptions, stat requirements, and consequences.
- After each choice, the impact on stats and story is summarized for the player.

### 4. Scene Setting & Imagery
- The first paragraph of every story must reference the current image's setting, objects, mood, and hooks.

### 5. Gamebook Structure & Tone
- Prompts enforce a structure: scene description, conflict, choices, consequences, stat changes.
- Formatting (bold/italic) is used for key moments and dialogue.

### 6. Testing & Iteration
- Jest tests ensure prompt structure, output parsing, and narrative continuity.
- Manual playtesting is recommended to catch edge cases and improve flow.

## Example Prompt Structure

```
You are an expert RPG storyteller. Output ONLY a valid JSON object with these keys: sceneTitle, summary, dilemmas, cues, consequences.

CONTEXT:
- Previous Chapters: [summary]
- Player: [name, stats, recent choices]
- Villain: [name, motivations, last action, state]
- Current Image: [description]

INSTRUCTIONS:
- First paragraph must reference the image's setting, objects, mood, and hooks.
- Build on previous story events and choices.
- Present a clear dilemma.
- Output 2-3 choices, each with stat requirements and consequences.
- Show how the villain's actions influence the scene.
- Update player stats as needed.
- Use bold for names and key moments, italics for dialogue/thoughts.

If you cannot create a valid JSON object, output: {}
```

## Implementation Notes
- See `src/hooks/useStoryGeneration.ts` and `src/lib/prompts/gameStatePrompts.ts` for prompt-building logic.
- See `src/lib/constants.ts` for strict prompt instructions and output format.
- See Jest tests for coverage of prompt structure and output validation.
