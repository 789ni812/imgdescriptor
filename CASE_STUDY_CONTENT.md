## Core Application Architecture

### 1. Fighter Management System (`/playervs`)

The Player vs Player page serves as the central hub for fighter creation and battle setup:

```typescript
// Core fighter upload and analysis
const handleFighterUpload = async ({ url, analysis }: { 
  url: string; 
  analysis: Record<string, unknown> 
}) => {
  const fighterName = extractFighterName(analysis, 'Unknown Fighter');
  const fighterStats = await generateFighterStats(analysis);
  
  const fighter: Fighter = {
    id: generateId(),
    name: fighterName,
    imageUrl: url,
    stats: fighterStats,
    visualAnalysis: analysis,
    combatHistory: [],
    winLossRecord: { wins: 0, losses: 0, draws: 0 }
  };
  
  setFighter('fighterA', fighter);
};
```

**Key Features:**
- **Image Upload & Analysis**: AI-powered fighter image analysis using LM Studio
- **Stat Generation**: Automatic generation of balanced fighter statistics
- **Fighter Balancing**: AI-driven stat adjustment for fair gameplay
- **Battle Setup**: Arena selection and battle configuration
- **Real-time Battle Simulation**: Live battle execution with health tracking

### 2. AI Fighter Balancing System

One of the most innovative features is the AI-powered fighter balancing system:

```typescript
// AI-based fighter stat balancing
export async function balanceFighterWithLLM(fighterData: FighterData) {
  const fighterTypeKey = classifyFighter(fighterData.name);
  const typeConfig = FIGHTER_TYPES[fighterTypeKey];
  
  const contextPrompt = `Generate balanced stats for a fighting game character.
  
  Fighter: ${fighterData.name}
  Type: ${typeConfig.name}
  Size: ${fighterData.stats.size}
  Build: ${fighterData.stats.build}
  
  Type Guidelines:
  - ${typeConfig.name}: Health ${typeConfig.healthRange[0]}-${typeConfig.healthRange[1]}, 
    Strength ${typeConfig.strengthRange[0]}-${typeConfig.strengthRange[1]}, 
    Agility ${typeConfig.agilityRange[0]}-${typeConfig.agilityRange[1]}
  `;
  
  const response = await fetch('http://127.0.0.1:1234/v1/chat/completions', {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
    body: JSON.stringify({
      model: 'local-model',
      messages: [
        {
          role: 'system',
          content: 'You are an expert at generating balanced fighter statistics...'
        },
        { role: 'user', content: contextPrompt }
      ],
      temperature: 0.3,
      max_tokens: 512
    })
  });
}
```

**Balancing Features:**
- **Fighter Classification**: Automatic categorization based on name and characteristics

### 3. Tournament System (`/tournament`)

The tournament system provides automated tournament creation and management:

```typescript
// Tournament creation and management
export default function TournamentPage() {
  const [viewMode, setViewMode] = useState<ViewMode>('list');
  const [selectedTournament, setSelectedTournament] = useState<Tournament | null>(null);

  const handleTournamentCreated = (tournament: Tournament) => {
    setSelectedTournament(tournament);
    setViewMode('tournament');
  };

  return (
    <div className="container mx-auto px-4 py-8">
      <div className="mb-6">
        <h1 className="text-3xl font-bold mb-2">Tournament System</h1>
        <p className="text-gray-600">
          Create and manage automated single-elimination tournaments with up to 8 fighters.
        </p>
      </div>
      
      {/* Tournament Controls */}
      <TournamentControls
        tournament={selectedTournament}
        onTournamentUpdated={handleTournamentUpdated}
      />
      
      {/* Tournament Bracket */}
      <TournamentBracket tournament={selectedTournament} />
    </div>
  );
}
```

interface FighterStats {
  name: string;
  totalBattles: number;
  wins: number;
  losses: number;
  winRate: number;
  totalDamageDealt: number;
  totalDamageTaken: number;
  averageDamageDealt: number;
  averageDamageTaken: number;
  averageRoundsSurvived: number;
  totalRounds: number;
  currentStats: { [key: string]: number | string };
  opponents: string[];
  arenas: string[];
  lastBattle: string;
  imageUrl?: string;
}
```

### 5. Battle Replay System

The battle replay system allows users to watch complete battle simulations:

```typescript
// Battle replay interface
interface BattleReplay {
  id: string;
  fighterA: Fighter;
  fighterB: Fighter;
  scene: Scene;
  battleLog: Array<{
    round: number;
    attacker: string;
    defender: string;
    attackCommentary: string;
    defenseCommentary: string;
    attackerDamage: number;
    defenderDamage: number;
    randomEvent: string | null;
    arenaObjectsUsed: string | null;
    healthAfter: {
      attacker: number;
      defender: number;
    };
  }>;
  winner: string;
  date: string;
}
```

**Replay Features:**

## AI Integration with LM Studio

### Local AI Processing Architecture

The application uses LM Studio for all AI features, ensuring privacy and performance:

```typescript
// LM Studio client configuration
const DESCRIBER_MODEL = 'google/gemma-3-4b';  // Image analysis model
const WRITER_MODEL = 'gemma-the-writer-n-restless-quill-10b-uncensored@q2_k';  // Story generation

export const analyzeImage = async (
  imageBase64: string,
  prompt: string
): Promise<AnalysisResult> => {
  const response = await fetch('http://127.0.0.1:1234/v1/chat/completions', {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
    body: JSON.stringify({
      model: DESCRIBER_MODEL,
      messages: [
        {
          role: 'system',
          content: IMAGE_ANALYSIS_SYSTEM_PROMPT,
        },
        {
          role: 'user',
          content: [
            { type: 'text', text: prompt },
            {
              type: 'image_url',
              image_url: { url: `data:image/jpeg;base64,${imageBase64}` },
            },
          ],
        },
      ],
      temperature: 0.7,
      max_tokens: 1024,
    }),
  });
};
```

### Prompt Engineering for Fighter Analysis

The system uses sophisticated prompt engineering for consistent AI responses:

```typescript
// Fighter analysis prompt template
export const FIGHTER_ANALYSIS_PROMPT = `Analyze this image as a potential fighter for a tournament system.

CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:
- Output ONLY a valid JSON object with the following keys: "name", "description", "stats", "visual_analysis"
- All property names and string values MUST be double-quoted
- "stats" must be an object with numeric values
- "visual_analysis" must include "age", "size", "build", "appearance", "weapons", "armor"

ANALYSIS FOCUS:
- **Name**: Identify the character or entity name
- **Description**: Brief description of the fighter
- **Stats**: Generate balanced statistics (health, strength, agility, defense, luck)
- **Visual Analysis**: Detailed physical characteristics and equipment

QUALITY REQUIREMENTS:
- Be specific and descriptive
- Focus on combat-relevant characteristics
- Identify potential strengths and weaknesses
- Consider size, build, and equipment in stat generation
- Ensure logical relationships between stats
`;
```

## Development Workflow & Testing

### Test-Driven Development (TDD) Implementation

The project strictly follows TDD principles with comprehensive test coverage:

```typescript
// Example test for fighter balancing
describe('Fighter Balancing', () => {
  test('should balance fighter stats using LLM', async () => {
    const mockFighterData = {
      name: 'Bruce Lee',
      stats: {
        health: 100,
        strength: 50,
        agility: 50,
        defense: 50,
        luck: 50,
        age: 32,
        size: 'medium',
        build: 'muscular'
      }
    };

    const result = await balanceFighterWithLLM(mockFighterData);
    
    expect(result.method).toBe('llm');
    expect(result.newStats.health).toBeGreaterThan(0);
    expect(result.newStats.strength).toBeGreaterThan(0);
    expect(result.newStats.agility).toBeGreaterThan(0);
  });
});
