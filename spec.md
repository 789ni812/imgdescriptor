## Project Overview
A Next.js application that allows users to upload images and get AI-generated descriptions and stories using the LM Studio SDK. The project follows a strict Test-Driven Development (TDD) workflow.

## Development Phases

### Phase 1-6: Initial Setup & Core AI Features - âœ… **Complete**
These phases covered the initial project setup, component creation, LM Studio integration for both image description and story generation, and the initial test environment configuration.

### Phase 7: UI/UX Overhaul - âœ… **Complete**
This phase transformed the application from a functional prototype into a polished tool with a consistent design language.
- **Tasks Completed:** Defined color palette and typography, created Header/Footer, overhauled core components (`ImageUpload`, `ImagePreview`, `DescriptionDisplay`, `StoryDisplay`) with modern card-based styling and improved functionality using `react-dropzone`.

### Phase 8: Advanced UI Polish & Layout Refinement - âœ… **Complete**
This phase focused on refining the overall structure and visual appeal of the application.
- **Tasks Completed:** Implemented a global centered content container, redesigned the Header and Footer with proper styling, enhanced text readability on display cards, and implemented a responsive two-column grid layout.

### Phase 9: Iconography & Action Elements Refinement - ðŸš§ **In Progress**
The goal of this phase is to improve usability and visual clarity by making icons and buttons more intuitive and appropriately styled.

- **Task 9.1: Refine and Control Icon Visibility & Style** - *Complete*
  - **Action:** Replaced placeholder SVGs with smaller, more conventional icons from `heroicons`. Conditionally rendered `ImagePreview` and `DescriptionDisplay` to clean up the initial view.
  - **Commit:** `feat(icons): replace placeholder with heroicons and control visibility`.

- **Task 9.2: Redesign Buttons for Clarity and Emphasis** - *Complete*
  - **Action:** Refactored the `Button` component to be variant-based (`primary`, `destructive`). Applied the `destructive` variant to the "Remove Image" button for better UX.
  - **Commit:** `feat(ui): implement variant-based buttons`.

- **Task 9.3: Reduce Icon Size Further (`w-12 h-12`)** - *Complete*
  - **TDD:** Wrote a failing test to assert the upload icon has `w-12` and `h-12` classes. Updated the component to pass the test.
  - **Commit:** `feat(icons): reduce icon size to w-12 h-12`.

- **Task 9.4: Correctly Scale Upload Icon Size and Stroke** - *Complete*
  - **TDD:** Wrote failing tests to:
    1.  Add custom CSS to `globals.css` for controlling heroicon `stroke-width`.
    2.  Update `ImageUpload.test.tsx` to assert the `ArrowUpOnSquareIcon` is larger (e.g., `w-16 h-16`) and has a custom stroke-width class (e.g., `heroicon-stroke-1`).
  - **Run Test:** Confirm failure.
  - **Code:**
    1.  Add `heroicon-stroke-*` classes to `src/app/globals.css`.
    2.  Update the `className` on the icon in `ImageUpload.tsx` to apply the new size and stroke classes.
  - **Run Test:** Confirm pass.
  - **Commit:** `feat(icons): increase upload icon size and apply custom stroke width`.

- **Task 9.5: Reduce Upload Icon Size to `w-14 h-14`** - *Complete*
  - **TDD:** Write a failing test in `ImageUpload.test.tsx` to assert the `ArrowUpOnSquareIcon` has `w-14` and `h-14` classes.
  - **Run Test:** Confirm failure.
  - **Code:** Update the class names in `ImageUpload.tsx`.
  - **Run Test:** Confirm pass.
  - **Commit:** `feat(icons): reduce upload icon size to w-14`.

- **Task 9.6: Debug Icon Size and Verify Tailwind**
  - **TDD (Header):** Write a failing test in `Header.test.tsx` to assert the title has a `text-blue-400` class. Update the component to pass.
  - **TDD (Icon):** Write a failing test in `ImageUpload.test.tsx` to assert the icon is wrapped in a `div` with inline styles `width: 50px` and `height: 50px`.
  - **Code:** Add the wrapper `div` in `ImageUpload.tsx` to pass the test.
  - **Commit:** `fix(ui): wrap upload icon and verify tailwind`.

### Phase 10: Final Polish & Readme
The goal of this phase is to finalize the application and prepare the final readme file.

- **Task 10.1: Finalize Readme File**
  - **Action:** Write a comprehensive readme file for the project. Ensure all sections are complete and accurate. Review and edit the file for clarity and completeness.
  - **Commit:** `docs: finalize project readme`.
