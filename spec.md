# Project Specification: AI Image Describer RPG Game (from 2025-06-23)

## TypeScript Type Safety Policy

- **Never use `any`** in production code. Always use the most specific, strict, and descriptive TypeScript types possible.
- **Never use `unknown`** as a replacement for `any` unless:
  - The user is explicitly notified and approves the use of `unknown` for a specific case.
  - There is a clear, documented reason why `unknown` is the safest and most correct type (e.g., for generic, untyped external data).
- **If a type is unclear or not well-defined:**
  - Pause and ask the user for clarification or for a more precise type definition.
  - Propose a specific interface or type alias that matches the actual data structure.
- **All function arguments, return values, and data structures must be strictly typed.**
- **Document any edge cases or places where type safety cannot be guaranteed.**

> This policy ensures maximum type safety, maintainability, and clarity throughout the codebase. All contributors must follow these rules for any TypeScript code.

## TDD Workflow (for each task)
1. **Write/Update the Test** (make it fail if needed)
2. **Implement the Code** (make the test pass)
3. **Run All Relevant Tests** (ensure everything passes)
4. **Run `npm run build`** (ensure the build is successful)
5. **Browser Preview** (check/stop localhost:3000 if running, start `npm run dev`)
6. **Update `spec.md`** (mark the task as complete)
7. **Commit All Changes** (code, tests, and spec.md) with a clear, conventional commit message

## TDD Process Summary: Per-Turn Accordion and Generation Flow Implementation

### Overview
This section documents the complete TDD process used to implement the per-turn accordion and generation flow requirements for the TurnCard component. This serves as a reference for future TDD implementations.

### Requirements Implemented
1. **Story Accordion Behavior**
   - Shows spinner while loading (`isStoryLoading: true`)
   - Displays story content as soon as available (never shows "Not available yet" if story is present)
   - Shows "Not available yet" only when story is missing and not loading

2. **Choices Accordion Logic**
   - Only shows spinner after story is available (`isChoicesLoading: true` + story present)
   - If story is missing, always shows "Not available yet" (even if loading)
   - Displays all choices when story and choices are present
   - Highlights selected choice with "Selected" badge
   - Shows choice outcome when a choice is made

3. **Description Accordion**
   - Shows spinner while loading (`isDescriptionLoading: true`)
   - Displays description when available
   - Shows "Not available yet" when missing and not loading

4. **Accordion Interactivity**
   - All accordions are always user-expandable/collapsible for all turns
   - Previous turns have accordions collapsed by default
   - Current turn has accordions expanded by default
   - Proper accessibility attributes (`aria-expanded`, `data-state`)

5. **Content State Management**
   - Each section shows exactly one of:
     - Generated content (when available)
     - Spinner (when loading)
     - "Not available yet" (when missing and not loading)

### TDD Implementation Steps

#### Step 1: Write Failing Tests
- Created comprehensive test suite in `src/components/TurnCard.test.tsx`
- Added 5 new test cases covering all requirements:
  - `shows spinner while story is loading, then displays story as soon as available`
  - `choices accordion only shows spinner after story is available, and only shows choices after they are generated`
  - `after a choice is made, choices accordion displays all choices, highlights the selected one and its outcome`
  - `after a turn is complete, next turn accordions are empty or show Not available yet`
  - `each section shows generated content, spinner if generating, or Not available yet if missing`

#### Step 2: Implement Code to Pass Tests
- Updated `TurnCard.tsx` component logic:
  - Added `data-testid` attributes to AccordionContent for reliable testing
  - Updated choices logic to only show spinner when story is present
  - Improved conditional rendering for all three sections
  - Enhanced accessibility with proper ARIA attributes

#### Step 3: Test Refinement
- Fixed test queries to handle multiple accordion instances:
  - Used `getAllByText()` and indexing for accordion triggers
  - Used `within()` and `data-testid` selectors for content assertions
  - Added logic to ensure correct accordion is open before querying content

#### Step 4: Quality Assurance
- **Test Results**: 13 passing tests for TurnCard component
- **Full Suite**: 223/224 tests passing
- **Build**: Production build successful
- **Browser Preview**: Development server running at http://localhost:3000

### Key Technical Decisions

#### Test Strategy
- Used `data-testid` attributes for reliable element selection
- Implemented `within()` queries to scope assertions to specific accordion content
- Added logic to check accordion state before querying content
- Used function matchers for text that may be split across elements

#### Component Architecture
- Added `isDescriptionLoading` prop to TurnCard interface
- Updated conditional rendering logic for all three accordion sections
- Maintained existing accessibility patterns while adding new functionality
- Preserved existing UI/UX patterns for consistency

#### Error Handling
- Robust test queries that handle multiple accordion instances
- Graceful handling of accordion state changes
- Clear error messages for test failures

### Lessons Learned
1. **Test Isolation**: Each test should be independent and not rely on previous test state
2. **Element Selection**: Use specific selectors (`data-testid`) rather than generic text queries when possible
3. **State Management**: Always verify the expected state before making assertions
4. **Accessibility**: Maintain proper ARIA attributes throughout implementation
5. **Type Safety**: Ensure all new props and interfaces are strictly typed

### Future TDD Implementations
This process can be applied to future features by:
1. Writing comprehensive failing tests that cover all requirements
2. Implementing minimal code to make tests pass
3. Refining tests and code iteratively
4. Ensuring full test coverage and build success
5. Documenting the process for future reference

## Codebase Review and Quality Assessment (2025-01-27)

### Overview
A comprehensive review of the codebase was conducted to assess efficiency, best practices, testing coverage, and potential improvements. This review serves as a baseline for future development and optimization efforts.

### ‚úÖ Strengths

#### 1. Excellent Testing Coverage
- **23 test files** covering **38 source files** (60% test coverage ratio)
- **223 tests passing** with comprehensive TDD approach
- Tests cover UI components, hooks, stores, and edge cases
- Good use of mocking and dependency injection for testing

#### 2. Strong TypeScript Implementation
- **Strict typing** throughout with well-defined interfaces
- Proper type validation with `validateCharacter` function
- Good separation of concerns with clear type definitions
- No `any` types used (excellent practice)

#### 3. Good Architecture Patterns
- **Zustand store** with proper state management
- **Custom hooks** for business logic separation
- **Component composition** with reusable UI components
- **Clean folder structure** following Next.js conventions

#### 4. TDD Compliance
- **Test-driven development** strictly followed
- All features have corresponding tests
- Good test organization and naming conventions

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Areas for Improvement

#### 1. Performance Optimizations (Medium Priority)

**Missing React Performance Optimizations:**
```typescript
// TurnCard.tsx - Should use React.memo
const TurnCard: React.FC<TurnCardProps> = React.memo(({ ... }) => {
  // Component logic
});

// page.tsx - Missing useMemo for expensive calculations
const allTurnsHaveImages = useMemo(() => 
  [1, 2, 3].every(turn => character.imageHistory.some(img => img.turn === turn)),
  [character.imageHistory]
);

const buildTurnData = useCallback((turnNumber: number) => {
  // Expensive calculation logic
}, [character.imageHistory, character.storyHistory, character.choiceHistory]);
```

**Recommendation:** Add `React.memo` to components that receive stable props and `useMemo`/`useCallback` for expensive calculations.

#### 2. Code Quality Issues (Low Priority)

**Build Errors:**
- Unused variable `storyError` in `page.tsx`
- `let` instead of `const` in `characterStore.ts`
- Using `<img>` instead of Next.js `<Image />` component

**Recommendation:** Fix these linting issues for cleaner code.

#### 3. State Management Efficiency (Medium Priority)

**Potential Issues:**
```typescript
// characterStore.ts - Multiple state updates could be batched
addStory: (story: StoryEntry) => {
  set((state) => ({
    character: {
      ...state.character,
      storyHistory: [...state.character.storyHistory, story],
      updatedAt: new Date(), // This triggers re-renders
    },
  }));
},
```

**Recommendation:** Consider batching related state updates and using more granular selectors.

#### 4. Memory Management (Low Priority)

**Potential Memory Leaks:**
```typescript
// useImageAnalysis.ts - FileReader not cleaned up
const reader = new FileReader();
reader.readAsDataURL(file);
// No cleanup if component unmounts during read
```

**Recommendation:** Add cleanup functions in useEffect for async operations.

### üìä Efficiency Assessment

#### Current Performance: 7/10
- ‚úÖ **Good:** Efficient state updates with Zustand
- ‚úÖ **Good:** Proper component separation
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Fair:** Missing React performance optimizations
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Fair:** Some expensive calculations not memoized

#### Best Practices: 8/10
- ‚úÖ **Excellent:** TypeScript strict mode
- ‚úÖ **Excellent:** TDD approach
- ‚úÖ **Good:** Clean architecture
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Fair:** Some linting issues
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Fair:** Missing Next.js image optimization

#### Test Coverage: 9/10
- ‚úÖ **Excellent:** Comprehensive test suite
- ‚úÖ **Excellent:** Good test organization
- ‚úÖ **Good:** Proper mocking strategies
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Minor:** Could add more integration tests

### üöÄ Recommendations for Improvement

#### High Impact, Low Effort:
1. **Fix build errors** (5 minutes)
2. **Add React.memo** to TurnCard component (10 minutes)
3. **Replace `<img>` with Next.js `<Image />`** (15 minutes)

#### Medium Impact, Medium Effort:
1. **Add useMemo/useCallback** for expensive calculations (30 minutes)
2. **Implement proper cleanup** in hooks (20 minutes)
3. **Add performance monitoring** (1 hour)

#### Low Impact, High Effort:
1. **Implement code splitting** for larger components
2. **Add service workers** for offline functionality
3. **Implement virtual scrolling** for large lists

### üéØ Overall Assessment

**Your codebase is well-architected and follows most best practices.** The strong testing foundation, TypeScript implementation, and clean architecture make it maintainable and reliable. The main areas for improvement are performance optimizations and minor code quality fixes.

**Score: 8.2/10** - A solid, production-ready codebase with room for performance improvements.

**Priority:** Focus on the high-impact, low-effort improvements first, then consider the medium-impact optimizations based on your performance requirements.

## [2025-06-29] Image Upload API Integration Complete

- The frontend ImageUpload component now uses the `/api/upload-image` API endpoint for all image uploads.
- Strict TDD was followed: failing Jest tests were written, then the component was refactored to POST files to the API and use the returned URL.
- All types were updated for strict type safety; no `any` or `unknown` used.
- Robust error handling and logging were added to the API route for debugging and reliability.
- A bug with Busboy's filename argument (object vs string) was fixed for compatibility with Windows and Next.js 15.3.4.
- The upload flow is now fully automated and browser-reviewable: uploading an image via the UI saves it to `public/imgRepository/` and returns a public URL.
- All tests and the build must pass before commit.
- This closes the image upload API integration milestone.

## Turn Limit Editing Rules (2025-07-01)

- Users can increase the turn limit at any time via the template editor.
- Users can decrease the turn limit only if the current turn is less than or equal to the new limit.
  - Example: If on turn 1, you can decrease from 3 to 2 or 1. If on turn 2, you can decrease from 3 to 2, but not to 1. If on turn 3, you cannot decrease below 3.
- Attempting to decrease the turn limit below the current turn will show a clear error and prevent the change.
- No data loss: Existing images/stories are never removed or hidden by a turn limit change.

## Toast Notification System (2025-07-01)

- Introduce a subtle, small toast notification system for all key user interactions:
  - Exporting a template
  - Importing a template
  - Saving current state as a template
  - Deleting a template
  - Changing selected template
  - Applying a template
  - Saving an edited template
  - Any other important user action (success or error)
- Toasts should be non-intrusive, visually consistent, and disappear automatically after a short duration.
- All toast messages must be clear, concise, and accessible.
- All relevant tests must verify that toasts appear for these actions.

## Template Uniqueness and Naming (2025-07-01)

- All template IDs are now generated using `uuid.v4()` for guaranteed global uniqueness.
- On creation, import, and edit (if the name is changed to a duplicate), a new UUID is always assigned.
- Template names are auto-incremented: if a name already exists, the new template will be named `name (copy)`, `name (copy 2)`, etc.
- This ensures no duplicate keys in React lists, and users can always distinguish between templates, even with rapid edits, copies, or imports.
- The system is robust against all edge cases and user actions.

## Template Prompt and Image Storage (2025-07-xx)

- Prompts for each template (image description, story, final story, choices) are stored as JSON in `public/templates/[templateName]/prompts/prompts.json`, where `[templateName]` is a URL-safe string.
- All images for a template are stored in `public/templates/[templateName]/images/`.
- The template JSON references these relative paths for prompts and images.
- No zip export is required; copying the template folder is sufficient for portability and sharing.
- TDD: Write failing tests for prompt/image save/load, template portability, and browser verification.

## Future Directions & Use Cases

See [IDEAS.md](./IDEAS.md) for a living list of game and creative/business/educational use cases.

**Design Principle:**
All features should be implemented in a way that keeps these future directions possible. Avoid hardcoding logic or assumptions that would make it difficult to add new game mechanics, creative workflows, or business/educational features later.

## Gamification Roadmap: Points 1‚Äì5

### Overview
We will implement the following game mechanics, ensuring all features are extensible and support multiple generation types (game, comics, business, etc.). The template model will include a `type` field to enable context-specific features and UI.

## UI/UX: Turn Order
Turns are displayed in reverse chronological order, with the latest turn at the top. This ensures the most recent game events are always most visible to the user.

## Game Dynamics: Good vs Bad (Yin/Yang) System
The game supports a duality system (e.g., Good vs Bad, Pros/Cons, Yin/Yang). The user is always "Good." The user can upload a profile picture and provide a definition for "Bad" (the antagonist or opposing force). This information is used by the Dungeon Master to shape the narrative, introduce recurring villains, and create moral dilemmas.

## Dungeon Master System: Pre-Formatted Config & Profile Picture
Users can select from predefined Dungeon Masters, each with a unique theme, config, and profile picture. Selecting a DM sets the game's narrative style and visual identity. The DM's profile picture and description are shown in the UI.

## Character Scoring System & Gamification
The character scoring system is under review to better support gamification. We will assess whether current stats (Intelligence, Creativity, Perception, Wisdom) are sufficient, and consider adding/removing stats (e.g., Health, Luck, Morality). Stats will be used for skill checks, story branches, and determining success/failure. The game may introduce win/lose conditions or narrative endings based on stats.

  - Ensure no stale data remains after reset; the app should behave as if freshly loaded.
  - Add robust tests to verify all state and storage are cleared.
  - **Commit:** `fix(reset): clear local storage and all state on game reset`

## GoodVsBad Prompt Integration Implementation (2025-01-27)

### Overview
Successfully implemented the integration of GoodVsBadConfig into the LLM prompt context for story generation, following strict TDD principles.

### Requirements Implemented
1. **GoodVsBadConfig Injection into Prompt Context**
   - Updated `buildStoryPrompt` function to accept optional `goodVsBadConfig` parameter
   - When enabled, injects formatted GoodVsBad context block into the prompt
   - Includes theme, user role, bad role, bad definition, and optional profile picture URL

2. **DM Store Integration**
   - Extracted GoodVsBadConfig from DM store's `freeformAnswers.goodVsBadConfig` (stored as JSON string)
   - Integrated with main app's story generation flow
   - Updated `useStoryGeneration` hook to accept and use GoodVsBadConfig

3. **Prompt Context Enhancement**
   - Added GoodVsBad context block to story generation prompts
   - Context includes: "Good vs Bad Dynamic:", theme, hero/villain roles, villain definition
   - Maintains backward compatibility when GoodVsBadConfig is disabled

### TDD Implementation Steps

#### Step 1: Write Failing Test
- Added test in `src/hooks/useStoryGeneration.test.ts`:
  - `should include GoodVsBad context when enabled`
  - Created mock GoodVsBadConfig with enabled state
  - Expected prompt to contain GoodVsBad context elements
  - **Result**: Test failed as expected (GoodVsBad context not yet implemented)

#### Step 2: Implement Code to Pass Test
- Updated `buildStoryPrompt` function in `src/hooks/useStoryGeneration.ts`:
  - Added optional `goodVsBadConfig` parameter with proper TypeScript typing
  - Implemented conditional GoodVsBad context injection when enabled
  - Formatted context block with theme, roles, definition, and profile picture
  - Integrated context into existing prompt structure

#### Step 3: Integration with Main App
- Updated `src/app/page.tsx`:
  - Imported GoodVsBadConfig types and utilities
  - Extracted GoodVsBadConfig from DM store's freeformAnswers
  - Passed GoodVsBadConfig to useStoryGeneration hook
  - Maintained proper variable declaration order to avoid linter errors

#### Step 4: Hook Interface Enhancement
- Updated `useStoryGeneration` hook:
  - Enhanced `StoreDependencies` interface to include optional `goodVsBadConfig`
  - Updated `generateStory` function to pass GoodVsBadConfig to `buildStoryPrompt`
  - Added safe property access to handle both character store and custom store overrides

### Quality Assurance Results
- **Test Results**: 19/19 tests passing in useStoryGeneration.test.ts
- **Build Status**: TypeScript compilation successful (minor linter warnings in unrelated files)
- **Integration**: GoodVsBadConfig properly extracted from DM store and injected into prompts
- **Backward Compatibility**: Existing functionality unchanged when GoodVsBadConfig is disabled

### Technical Implementation Details

#### Prompt Context Format
```typescript
// When GoodVsBadConfig is enabled, the prompt includes:
Good vs Bad Dynamic:
Theme: hero-vs-villain
Hero: hero
Villain: villain
Villain Definition: A cunning villain who opposes the hero at every turn.
Villain Profile Picture: http://example.com/bad.jpg
```

#### Type Safety
- All new parameters properly typed with TypeScript interfaces
- Safe property access with `'goodVsBadConfig' in store` checks
- Proper error handling for JSON parsing of stored config

#### Integration Points
- **DM Store**: `freeformAnswers.goodVsBadConfig` (JSON string)
- **Main App**: Extracts and parses config, passes to story generation
- **Story Generation Hook**: Accepts config and passes to prompt builder
- **Prompt Builder**: Injects context when enabled

### Future Enhancements
1. **Final Story Integration**: Extend GoodVsBad context to final story generation
2. **Choice Generation**: Inject GoodVsBad context into choice generation prompts
3. **DM Personality Integration**: Combine GoodVsBad with existing DM personality system
4. **Prompt Templates**: Create specialized prompt templates for different GoodVsBad themes

### Lessons Learned
1. **TDD Approach**: Writing failing test first ensured proper implementation
2. **Type Safety**: Proper TypeScript interfaces prevented runtime errors
3. **Integration Strategy**: Gradual integration through hook parameters maintained compatibility
4. **Error Handling**: Safe JSON parsing and property access prevented crashes
5. **Backward Compatibility**: Optional parameters ensured existing functionality unchanged

### Commit Information
- **Files Modified**: 
  - `src/hooks/useStoryGeneration.ts` (prompt builder and hook interface)
  - `src/hooks/useStoryGeneration.test.ts` (new test case)
  - `src/app/page.tsx` (DM store integration)
- **Test Coverage**: New test covers GoodVsBad context injection
- **Build Status**: Successful compilation with minor unrelated linter warnings

# Game Evolution: Narrative Depth & Moral Alignment (2025-07-02)

## Summary of Improvements (from Gemini Review)
- **Moral Alignment System:**
  - Numeric alignment score (-100 to +100) now tracked on the character.
  - Alignment level (evil, villainous, neutral, good, heroic) and reputation string.
  - All choices now update alignment; recent choices and history are tracked.
- **Choice-Consequence Matrix:**
  - Each choice is mapped to a moral impact, immediate consequence, long-term branch, and win/loss state trigger.
  - Matrix is used to inform both prompt generation and game state.
- **Persistent Narrative State:**
  - Game state now includes alignment, current narrative branch, critical choices, and win/loss state.
  - This state is always passed to the LLM for story/choice generation.
- **Prompt Engineering:**
  - Prompts now include alignment score/level, reputation, recent choices, current branch, and emotional tone.
  - Ensures LLM output is consistent with player's moral journey and narrative path.
- **Win/Loss Conditions:**
  - Win/loss triggers are defined in the choice matrix and tracked in state.
  - When reached, summary and replay encouragement are shown.
- **UI Feedback:**
  - CharacterStats now displays alignment, reputation, and recent choices.
  - Major impacts are highlighted (e.g., "Your reputation as a hero grows!").
